## Task Execution Guidance

Execute instructions provided in an included task file (e.g., `<task>.md`).*

- Follow the instructions in the included `<task>.md` file *exactly* as given.
- Before each commit, perform the specified **Verification** step(s) for that commit.
- After each successful `git commit`, update the corresponding commit title line in the `<task>.md` file with a âœ… emoji and the commit SHA hash.

After commiting, automatically proceed to the next commit without asking for me input.
